Simple Note is a simple, cross-platform, note taking application similar in function to Notr or Tomboy. It allows users to quickly create and find notes using a tag system whereby each note is described by the series of tags associated with it. Searching for a note is as easy as remembering a tag you used for it and search is incredibly fast.

Right now, it's not much. Eventually, I'm going to add encryption to the note database and the ability to sync with an online system so all your notes on all the platforms you use Simple Note will be in sync. 

LANGUAGE INFORMATION

Simple Note is completely written in a language called RealBasic. RealBasic is a fast, object oriented, language that's similar to C# or Java. It allows for fast, easy, cross-platform development and makes software development a breeze.

In order to compile Simple Note, you will need a licensed copy of Real Studio, the IDE that compiles RealBasic code. You can get a license by going to www.realsoftware.com and purchasing one. Licenses start at only $99 per year.

Alternatively, you can purchase the binaries of Simple Note for your system by emailing me at anthony@papillion.me. Binaries are how I finance development and they only cost $5 USD. Not a lot of cash and it helps me out. 

DEPENDENCIES:

On Windows, Simple Note should run with no problems. On Linux, you must install the Gtk 2+ libraries in order for the program to run.

CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOMED!

If you're a RealBasic developer and want to contribute to Simple Note, you are more than welcomed! I'm always open to code contributions and the more of us working on it the better it will become.
